# find-your-hat

What do you like about the project?

I enjoyed seeing the game slowly evolving from the initial field to a complete game with prompts and randomly generated fields.

What did you struggle with in this project?

I struggled with using external resources to implement my own solutions. Finding out how other people are doing it and understanding their logic and flow. But slowly I managed to understand and make use of these resources for my own solutions.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?

I think the pace of the learning is a bit fast. I feel like my learning was in a bubble and when trying to understand solution from other people it was abit confusing at the start.
